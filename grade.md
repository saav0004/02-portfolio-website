## Comments

### HTML

- `tabindex="0"` is not necessary on links and other elements that are tababble by default
- Software stack cards should not be `<a>` as they don't actually link anywhere. You should also remove the hover state.

Search for `prof feedback` in individual files for specific comments.

### Bootstrap/SASS

- You should not be using `px`

### Responsive Design

Fantastic work! Looks great on all screen sizes.

### Assignment Requirements

All requirements completed.
